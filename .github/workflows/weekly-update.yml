#  Weekly Module Update
# =============================================================================
# This workflow runs weekly to update and test the latest `go.mod` version.
#
# If all the tests succeeds to run in all Go versions, it will create a new PR
# of the `go.mod` and `go.sum`.
#
# NOTE:
# You need to set the `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable in the repo's
#     [Settings]-[Secrets]-[Actions secrets]
# To generate a new token go to:
#     https://github.com/settings/tokens
#     * You need add the "repo" scope to the token but no more.
